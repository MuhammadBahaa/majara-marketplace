Free, open AI-agent skills from **Majarrah Nexus**. Works with Codex, Claude
Code, and every agent that supports the Agent Skills open standard — including
Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| [`skill-craft`](plugins/skill-craft) | Technical review and guided walkthroughs for agent skills, slash commands, and plugins. |
| [`code-craft`](plugins/code-craft) | Clean Architecture feature implementation in whatever stack a project already uses. |

## Install

Every route installs the same skills. Pick the one that matches your agent.

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add MuhammadBahaa/majarrah-marketplace
codex plugin marketplace list
codex plugin list
codex plugin add skill-craft@majarrah-marketplace
codex plugin add code-craft@majarrah-marketplace
```

`codex plugin list` should now show `skill-craft@majarrah-marketplace` and
`code-craft@majarrah-marketplace` as `installed, enabled`. Start a
new Codex task to load the skills.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add MuhammadBahaa/majarrah-marketplace
# then, inside Claude Code:
/plugin install skill-craft@majarrah-marketplace
/plugin install code-craft@majarrah-marketplace
```

`/plugin` lists what is installed — `skill-craft` and `code-craft` should both
be enabled. Start a new session to load the skills.

### Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and others

```bash
npx skills add MuhammadBahaa/majarrah-marketplace
```

[skills.sh](https://skills.sh/MuhammadBahaa/majarrah-marketplace) installs into
the shared Agent Skills directory these agents read. Gemini CLI alternative:
`gemini skills install <skill-folder-or-git-url>`. Reload skills or restart the
agent afterwards.

### Manual copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadBahaa/majarrah-marketplace
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cp -r majarrah-marketplace/plugins/*/skills/* ~/.agents/skills/
```

That copies every skill in the marketplace; name a single plugin instead of the
`*` to take just one. Use `~/.agents/skills/` (user-wide) or
`<project>/.agents/skills/` (per project). Cursor and Copilot also read
`~/.claude/skills`, so a Claude Code install covers them too. Restart the agent
afterwards.
